#### Docker Compose (Highly recommended)
```yaml
service:
    api:

        environment:
            AUTH_ISSUER=<OAuth domain>
            AUTH_AUDIENCE=<OAuth ClientID>
            REDIS_HOST=
            REDIS_PORT=
    web:
        image: img2
        environment:
            API_URL=api
            AUTH_DOMAIN=<OAuth domain>

### Authentication
The project right now required an OAuth provider, you will need to configure an OAuth provider for logging in. You can use any authentication services that are capatible with OAuth 2.0 (Open id connect). If you don't know where to start, Auth0 is a good choise, or you can self host one with [Identity Server from Duende](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver).
